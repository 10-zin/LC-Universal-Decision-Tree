# LC-Universal-Decision-Tree
A distilled decision tree framework to solve any LeetCode question systematically.

# Preliminary Thoughts

## Basic Idea:

Formulate a Decision Tree Mental Model of questions.

This is an ever-evolving decision tree.

## Hypothesis/Motivation
We all have this decision tree innate in our mind somewhere.

For those who occasionally fail LC questions. Their decision tree is flaky.

For those who occasionally pass LC question they’ve seen before. Their in-distribution decision tree is strong.

For those who can often solve problems with ambiguous patterns. Their decision tree has strong contrastive branches. Contrastive branches → They have nodes that branch on problems that sound similar but have to be solved with different techniques, otherwise are unsolvable. Like sliding window, but the numbers are negative → so sliding wont work. Or sliding window but requires subsequences → requires dynamic programming.

For those who can do competitive programming level questions at east. Their decision tree is so wide, deep, and factually verified through practice. That traversing this tree in their mind is like second nature, it's muscle memory to them.

## Problem/Solution
It is very difficult to acquire/form this decision tree in your mind.
At a very raw level, the robustness of this decision tree is directly propotional to the LC question/s you solve.
And contemporary approach is for everyone to start from 0.

Every newcommer is training their mind from scratch.

From an AI POV, everyone is pre-training their mind from scratch, even if they dont have the time budget. This is expensive.

Rather, we should fine-tune, and start from an existing pre-trained mind. In this case the pre-trained mind is represented as a decision tree, that we can quickly grasp through a logical understanding and lesser number of LC question/s.

If we can transfer our learning/s of this deicsion tree, each new decision node/branch/leaf node we learn, if we can transfer it across our minds through a centralized distilled verifiied and crowsdourced universal decision tree.
This could speed track any newcommer. Encourage newcommers to think from a patterns perspective/ first principles. 


## Thoughts

Given any question.

Consider word/phrases in it as constraints.

Each word/phrase affects the path down your decision tree.

Eventually you reach some leaf nodes → final concept/s pattern/s you must use to solve the question.


I am not sure if anyone has exhaustively distilled their decision tree encoded in the mind on the internet. But it would be really helpful for everyone if we did.

I do see traces of this decision tree. You will find many LC forums with people suggesting certain word/phrases→decision translations. Like if you see “find min/max” try DP, If you see sub-array try “sliding window”. But there is no single big tree that everyone contributes to occasionally to form a decision tree…

I am not totally sure, but its also possible for some/many questions the technique required may not directly be inferable from the word/phrases present in question. It may involve “meta” thinking.

By no means, am I an awesome LC solver, let alone a competitive programmer. But I do know some really awesome LC and competitive programmers. These people have pretty much 100% interview success rate.

We would really need these elites to raise the level of the decision tree. But until then here’s what I have (TBD), and no matter at what level you are right now, you can contribute. Each decision node, branching will be put to test/verified with real LC question/s.

We can/must augment the creation of this decision tree with LLMs. Especially the new one’s with reasoning capabilities gpt-O1.
